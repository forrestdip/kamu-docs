Before you start working on anything:
1. Consider joining our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/aSpVjWwu) to discuss your ideas
2. Make sure your work has an associated **GitHub issue**, it's assigned to you, and the scope of work was agreed upon with project maintainers (we value your time and really don't like rejecting PRs!)
3. Read the [Developer Guide]({{<ref "developer-guide">}}) on setting up your environment
4. Understand the [Licensing Terms]({{<ref "license">}})
